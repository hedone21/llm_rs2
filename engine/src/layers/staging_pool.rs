//! Migration Step 3-B (V-27): `WeightStagingPool` trait — abstraction over
//! pre-allocated [`TransformerLayer`] suppliers used by the swap path.
//!
//! Decouples [`crate::models::weights::SwapExecutor`] from the concrete
//! `LayerObjectPool` impl so the BG-fetch dispatch path can take entries
//! through a trait object. Enables:
//! - Mocking the pool in unit tests (DIP).
//! - Adding alternate pool strategies (CPU staging, OpenCL host_ptr) without
//!   touching the executor (OCP).
//!
//! The trait lives in `L3-inference` alongside `TransformerLayer` so the
//! `take()` return type is import-natural. The concrete `LayerObjectPool`
//! impl stays in `models/weights/` (also L3-inference) — no file relocation
//! was needed to resolve V-27; the downcast to `CudaBackend` was replaced
//! by [`crate::core::backend::Backend::bind_current_thread`].
