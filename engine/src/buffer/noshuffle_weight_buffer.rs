//! `NoshuffleWeightBuffer` — replaces the original Q4_0 `cl_mem` after SOA
//! conversion so that the AOS allocation can be released.
//!
//! Motivation
//! ----------
//! `convert_q4_0_to_noshuffle()` produces a separate `q_buf` + `d_buf` pair
//! (plus an optional `q_img`). On Adreno/UMA those SOA allocations are fully
//! sufficient for both decode (`matmul_q4_0_noshuffle`) and prefill
//! (`matmul_q4_0_gemm_adreno` via `mul_mat_Ab_Bi_8x4`). The original AOS
//! `cl_mem` is therefore dead weight (~523 MiB across 112 Q4_0 tensors for
//! Llama 3.2 1B) and should be dropped.
//!
//! Design
//! ------
//! After conversion we swap the weight tensor's backing buffer with a
//! `NoshuffleWeightBuffer` that owns the `NoshuffleSoaEntry` and returns the
//! SOA `d_buf` from `cl_mem()`. Two effects:
//!
//! 1. The old `OpenCLBuffer` / `UnifiedBuffer` `Arc` drops to 0 once the
//!    caller hands over the replacement tensor, which triggers
//!    `clReleaseMemObject` on the AOS allocation.
//! 2. `OpenCLBackend::lookup_noshuffle_soa()` keys on `b_buf.as_ptr() as
//!    usize`. Because the swapped buffer returns `d_buf`, the registry key
//!    becomes the SOA `d_buf` pointer — stable as long as the weight tensor
//!    (and therefore this `NoshuffleWeightBuffer`) is alive.
//!
//! The SOA registry still holds a reference to the entry for lookup, but the
//! real owner of the SOA `cl_mem`s is this buffer — see
//! `OpenCLBackend::register_noshuffle_soa_placeholder`.
//!
//! The buffer is tagged `Q4_0` so that `Tensor::dtype()` still reports Q4_0
//! for the weight, keeping `matmul_transposed()` dispatch unchanged.
