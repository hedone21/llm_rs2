//! Phase 4-3 C2 positive: `ModelForward` implements `Forward`, so a
//! `DecodeLoopBuilder` can accept it via `.with_forward(...)` and reach the
//! `.build()` typestate state.
//!
//! Compile-only fixture — no runtime model is loaded. The presence of the
//! `with_forward(model_forward).build()` chain is what we want trybuild to
//! type-check. `ModelForward::new` is not invoked because that would require
//! a backend / memory / model triple this fixture cannot construct.
