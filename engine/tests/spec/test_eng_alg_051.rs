//! Spec test: ENG-ALG-051 Unified QCF — O_before normalisation symmetry.
//!
//! ENG-ALG-051 was revised (2026-06-12, spec commit `eab908ab`) so that
//! `O_before` is normalised by the **full** token-set α-sum `Σ_s α_s`, sharing
//! the same softmax-weight space as `O_after`'s retained-set normalisation.
//! These tests pin the two consequences of that revision:
//!
//!   1. **Identity action → QCF = 0** (invariant, spec L647-652): when an action
//!      retains every token, `retained == full set`, so `O_after == O_before` and
//!      `QCF == 0`. This holds *only* because `O_before` is now normalised — with
//!      raw `Σ_t α_t V_t` the identity retain would give
//!      `O_after = O_before / Σ_s α_s ≠ O_before`.
//!   2. **Saturation regression guard**: with an accumulated (unnormalised)
//!      attention score whose sum is ≫ 1 (e.g. Σα ≈ 12, the decode score-sink
//!      regime that previously saturated QCF at ~0.985), the metric is now
//!      scale-invariant and yields a small QCF (< 0.5) for a realistic
//!      (correlated-V, sink-preserving) eviction.
